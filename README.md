# ThumbsUpShutDown
This code shuts down a laptop when a thumb is shown on a Macbook Computer. 
I used a lot of software to complete this simple project. 
1. Python for developing the code
2. OpenCV and Mediapipe to recognize the thumb using Machine Learning
3. Vim to access the superuser do (sudo in order to make it easier to shut down the system without a password for safety purposes)
